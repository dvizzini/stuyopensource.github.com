description: <b><a href="xmobile.html">xmobile</a></b> is a joint and proprietary venture of the College of Engineering and the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley, for which I was the first software engineer. It is a mobile platform on which to preform behavioral science experiments. I built it with <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a>, <a href="http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">Tastypie</a>, and <a href="http://developer.android.com/index.html">Android</a>, including geofencing capabilities, timers, persistent memory, and scalability through abstraction. I deployed it on an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> instance.

			<a href="http://xmobile.berkeley.edu">xmobile.berkeley.edu</a> is a joint and proprietary venture of the College of Engineering and the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley, for which I was the first software engineer. It is a mobile platform on which to preform behavioral science experiments.
		</p>
		<p>
			To preform such experiments, I coded its API using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a> and <a href="http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">Tastypie</a>, as well as an <a href="http://developer.android.com/index.html">Android</a> client that featured geofencing capabilities, timers, persistent memory, and scalability through abstraction.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition, I supervised the development of an HTML client for in-lab experiments.
		</p>
		<p>
			I deployed the system on an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> instance.

			Over the summer of 2012, xmobile was successfully implemented in a small run of <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w16791.pdf">this behavioral economics experiment</a>. Various members of the Berkeley faculty intend to use it for larger-scale studies.
